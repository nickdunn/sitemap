## Installation

1. Upload the 'sitemap' folder in this archive to your Symphony 'extensions' folder.
2. Enable it by selecting the "Publish Filtering", choose Enable from the with-selected menu, then click Apply.
3. Select Blueprints > Sitemap to view the sitemap

## Configuration
The site map needs to know which are the top level pages in your site, and which are the global pages. By default it assumes the top level pages have the type "primary" and global pages have the type "global". If you use a different convention in your Page Type field then you can change these in the System > Preferences page. Additionally you can exclude specific page types. The default excludes are: hidden, XML, 403 and 404.
